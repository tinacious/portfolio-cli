# portfolio-cli

`portfolio-cli` is a tool that Tina uses to build custom links to curate portfolio items for specific clients and job applications, because it's 2024 and we now have to apply for jobs ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It requires the environment variable `TINACIOUS_DESIGN_JWT_SECRET` be set. This would be the same JWT token used to read it server-side. You probably wouldn't know it unless you're Tina.

After hitting Enter, I can choose which technologies I want to highlight, picking only technologies relevant for the role so as to not overwhelm the recruiter or hiring manager.

This results in a custom link that is valid for 60 days which can be copied to the clipboard, e.g. if you do `portfolio-cli | pbcopy`.

In supported terminal emulators, holding <kbd>Command</kbd> and clicking the link will enable it to open in the default browser.
