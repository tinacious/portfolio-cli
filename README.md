# portfolio-cli

`portfolio-cli` is a tool that Tina uses to build custom links to curate portfolio items for specific clients and job applications, because it's 2024 and we now have to apply for jobs ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It requires the environment variable `TINACIOUS_DESIGN_JWT_SECRET` be set. This would be the same JWT token used to read it server-side. You probably wouldn't know it unless you're Tina.
